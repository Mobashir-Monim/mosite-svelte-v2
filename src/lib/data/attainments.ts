This groundbreaking initiative incorporated a novel Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol, which significantly advanced the efficiency of record management. Notably, the findings and innovations from this project were disseminated through a publication presented at an IEEE Region 10 conference, underscoring the scholarly and practical impact of the endeavor.'

	'Land Registry documents are legally binding documents provided by the government to owners of land as proof of their ownership. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, it is essential to combat the challenges which a traditional Land Registry system faces. To keep a digital ledger of information about land assets in a transparent and secured manner, Blockchain technology can be used to overcome the hurdle. However, any Blockchain based system needs to be integrated in a well thought out manner. We propose a novel approach on enhancing the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus to provide a private ledger based system for transacting land assets which can be easily integrated into the existing traditional Land Registry system for smooth operation.',
